Feel free to use my code or contribute your code too, but for the latter you'd either have to learn to use Github or send your code to me to add. My only condition is that every function you write must have a simple documentation; see the comments in `dom2mesh2D.m` as an example.

You are also responsible for making sure that your function correctly delivers what you claim it can do.
